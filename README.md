# Weekend Jam - Conway's Game of Life

While reading things on [/r/gamedev](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev) I came across [this](http://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/2u7856/im_obsessed_with_figuring_out_how_this_is_made/) post that got me really intrigued with pattern algorithms and other programs like that.
I decided too see how interesting of a program I could make in a weekend (it might go a bit longer then a weekend) that used some kind of either pattern algorithm or w.e.
I decided to remake Conway's Game of Life (CGoL).

## Goals:
- Basic CGoL implementation
- Juicifying it and making it look awesome


## If I get time:
- Basic state editor so you can set up and play with al the parameters in realtime
